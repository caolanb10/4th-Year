My name is Caolan Barry and I am a fourth year Computer Science student who is studying for an integrated masters program in computer science. I am seeking to do a software engineering internship beginning in January next year and would love to join one of the teams at Hubspot.
Throughout my college education as well as from developing projets on my own, with other students as well as professionally, I have gained excellent programming skills in Java, Python, C# as well as having a small amount of experience with web-based languages such as javascript, HTML and CSS. I have developed 2 projects for the unity framework, working with Augmented reality devices such as the Hololens as well as ARCore for Android. I have an interest in developing software and I am looking for a new challenge that I feel hubspot will provide.
